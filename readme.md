## tl;dr ##
MOPS is a utility for the family or neighborhood "system administrator" to help keep desktop and laptop PCs running smoothly.

## The Story ##
You're the "system administrator" for your family and perhaps a few friends. There are several PCs (laptops and/or desktops) that you are expected to keep running smoothly.  However, they are strewn across the house and maybe even in other locations.  The kids may be in college or just living on their own.  Your spouse may be on a business trip.  Even if it's a laptop on the other side of the house, you don't really get a chance to look at it.  It doesn't matter - you're still expected to make sure all of these systems are fine and not on the verge of having a major issue.

Many issues have relatively simple causes.  Perhaps the user is putting all their movies on a laptop intended just for homework and running out of disk space, causing the system to be very slow.  The system RAM might now be too small for what they're running.  Or perhaps the system has been running for a very long time and just needs to be rebooted.

MOPS can help by providing major system metrics for all your PCs.  It can also help you remote log-in to a system in case it needs more in-depth analysis.

## Usage ##
MOPS uses a redis database in the cloud, which you can get for free from [redis labs](http://www.redislabs.com). Simply sign up and create a redis 'endpoint' and password.  You will then enter your endpoint and password into MOP's preferences.

## Open Source ##
MOPS is entirely [open source](http://github.com/jamesabel/mops).  This way you are assured that it is not 'malware' or otherwise improperly using your computers or your data.

## Privacy ##
In addition to being open source, your data is private.  You are using your own redis account which is yours alone.  You are not using and servers associated with MOPS itself.

## Description ##

MOPS is an "operations" tool for your home and small business computers.  It monitors all of the PCs it's installed on and provides handy information about those PCs.

It provides things such as:

- Disk usage
- Up time
- Remote Desktop connectivity (within your LAN)
